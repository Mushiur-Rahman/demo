		<h1>THE BMW k 1300 RR</h1>

<p>Anyone who looks at it immediately understands that this is a high performance motorcycle. Every part of the RR has been designed to get the most out of it. Take, for instance, the frame layout with its new suspension technology that makes the RR lighter and more precise. In addition, there is the ergonomically focused seating position, which is unrivaled thanks to the modified frame and fairing design. Always pushing to the limit and in search of the ideal line, you've got 205 HP beneath you. Unbridled power pushes your RR to the max - with a maximum torque of 83 lb-ft at 11,000 rpm and a torque curve of at least 74 lb-ft over a range of 5,500 to 14,500 [rpm]. Ten years after the first generation of the RR first mesmerized the world of motorcycles, we're now entering the next level of performance. We have updated almost every component of the RR - from the front to the rear. The result: less weight and noticeably higher performance. Are you ready for the pole position and for victory? The RR awaits you. The standard LED headlights give the bike a dynamic and aggressive look. The front indicators have moved from the fairing to the rearview mirrors, which not only looks aesthetically pleasing, but it also provides improved visibility. Seen from the rear, the RR dominates in terms of design and functionality: "All-in-one" is the motto here. In addition to license plate lighting, the license plate bracket now also includes LED turn signals, tail lights and brake lights.</p>
